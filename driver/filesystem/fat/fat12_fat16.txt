	There are the following ways to determine FAT type:

	(1) "FAT12" or "FAT16" string in the boot block. Not reliable and not supported
	in all DOS versions.

	(2) "Sector/cluster count rules" -- described for example in the Tech Help.
	Varies between DOS versions. Even if you know the DOS version, you can still
	be wrong as the disk might have been formatted on a different version.

	(3) Partition type. Seems to be totally ignored by DOS and sometimes very
	unreliable as DOS's format command doesn't alter this during reformatting
	(if you create the partition by one DOS version and format it by another one,
	an inconsistency might arise).

	(4) Number of sectors per FAT -- this value must be correct as the root
	directory position is calculated from it, but it sometimes allows both
	possibilities (although such cases are very rare).

	(5) Number of 0xff's at the start of the FAT. As you can remember, the first
	two cluster numbers are reserved for special purposes and their FAT entries
	are set to 0xff with an exception of the first FAT byte which contains a media
	descriptor. If there are less than 3 0xff's, the FAT must be 12-bit. In other
	case, both types are possible.

	No No No No! Page 3-7 of the MS-DOS Technical information (the real
	system integrator's manual) states:

	"For disks containing more than 4085 clusters (note that
	4085 is the correct number), a 16-bit FAT entry is used."

	The number of clusters is calculated from the BPB in the boot record from
	the BYTE Custer size and the rest of the information about the size
	of the media. The number of sectors entry is the total of the media.
	You perform the indicated operations which even provides for the
	reserved sectors (like for the boot record), and come up with the
	number of clusters.

	----- (some code resembling the BIOSParamBlock struct) -----

	This will always work. It must work. This is how MS-DOS knows the size
	of the media.

	I used to get paid for making strange media work on MS-DOS. This will
	always work. The media descriptor doesn't mean anything any more nor
	does the OEM Name, etc. However the other information is updated in
	this table when the disk is formatted. The boot record loading code
	with a 360 kb floppy boot-record BPB is used by FORMAT, etc. It is
	modified before being written to the physical media. This same boot
	record is used for all MS-DOS media and is modified before being written.

	You can copy the boot record from a 1.2 mb floppy to a 1.44 mb floppy
	and you will find that MS-DOS thinks it is now a 1.2 mb floppy. You
	can use format/u to reformat it "as-is", and it is now a 1.2 mb floppy!

	This is correct, but not sufficient for FAT type detection as you can
	have a disk with _less_ than 4085 clusters and 16-bit FAT.

	Have a nice fortnight

	Not if it's a disk supported by MS-DOS or created using MS-DOS tools.
	MS-DOS format will not (read cannot) make such a disk. Even with its
	media type/size/heads options, it doesn't have the code necessary to
	produce a disk under any other rules because it calculates the
	clusters not you, and it uses the 4085 cluster rule for writing the FAT.

	Just because, in principle I can make a disk with one cluster and a 16-bit
	FAT, does not mean that it is a MS-DOS disk. MS-DOS will not understand
	such a disk so no other OS should bother with such a deviation either.

	I once came across a DOS floppy formatted with FAT16; I think some (OEM?)
	version of DOS 2.x or 3.x always formatted FAT16. Surprised the
	living daylight out of me...

	Unfortunately, the rules are not the same for different DOS versions :-(
